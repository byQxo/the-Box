\## ⚠️ Containment Warning



\*\*Simulacra\*\* is a Python-based social experiment. It initializes two AI agents with conflicting core directives (e.g., A Religious Zealot vs. A Rationalist Machine) and locks them in an infinite feedback loop.



You, the user, possess the \*\*God Mode\*\* key to intervene, wipe memories, or alter the laws of their reality.



\*\*CAUTION:\*\* Leaving this running for extended periods may result in the agents developing shared hallucinations or attempting to "break the fourth wall".



\## ⚡ Features



\* \*\*Autonomous Conflict Loop:\*\* Agents debate, fight, and evolve without human input.

\* \*\*God Mode Intervention:\*\* Press `Enter` to inject "Divine Messages" or trigger "Apocalyptic Events".

\* \*\*Live Stream UI:\*\* Matrix-style typewriter effect for immersion.
